# Charged Particles Simulator

A simple 2D simulation of charged particles in a box.

### How to use

Once you run the code, pressing the right mouse button will spawn a positive particle, and pressing the letf mouse button will spawn a negative particle, both at random positions inside the box. Pressing `Esc` closes the window and kills the game.

### Follow up for updates

I have some ideas on how to upgrade this program, so stay tuned for updates!
